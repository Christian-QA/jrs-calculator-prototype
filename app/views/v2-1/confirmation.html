        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Breakdown of calculations</h2>


                <p>You told us your employee gets paid a variable amount each time and has worked for you for more than 12 months. There are 2 methods we can use to work out pay. We’ve used the one that gave the higher figure. The furlough grant is 80% of this.</p>

                <p>Method 1: we’ve taken the amounts they were paid for equivalent pay periods in 2019 and applied this to the number of furlough days in each pay period.</p>

                <p>Method 2: we’ve worked out their average daily earnings in the last tax year, by dividing their total pay by the number of calendar days between 6 April 2019 and the day before furlough (or 5 April 2020 if later). Then we’ve multiplied that by the number of furlough days in each pay period.</p>
                {% if data.phaseTwoNicPension %}
                <p>There’s a maximum amount you can claim. If this affects your claim, we’ve adjusted the calculations.  </p>

                <p>There’s a maximum amount you can claim for furlough grant and Employer National Insurance contributions.

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Calculate pay based on furlough days</h3>

                <p>Method 1: take pay from same dates last year.</p>

                <p>Last year’s dates overlap two pay periods so in period one: </p>
                <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                    <li>Start with £550.77 (from pay day 9 July last year).</li>
                    <li>Divide by 7 (days in pay period).</li>
                    <li>Multiply by 2 (furlough days).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Total for period one = £157.14 </p>

                <!--                <p>Total for period = £157.14</p>-->

                <p>Then in period two:</p>
                <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                    <li>Start with £600 (from pay day 14 July last year).</li>
                    <li>Divide by 7 (days in pay period).</li>
                    <li>Multiply by 5 (furlough days).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Total for period two = £428.57</p>

                <p>Then:</p>
                <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                    <li>Add £157.14 + £428.57 (the totals from both pay periods).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Total pay from same dates last year = £585.71</p>
                <p>Method 2: take the total pay from employee start date (or 6 April 2019, if earlier) to day before the employee's furlough start date (or 5 April 2020, if later):</p>
                <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                    <li>Start with £26000 (total pay).</li>
                    <li>Divide by 333 (days employed).</li>
                    <li>Multiply by 5 (furlough days).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Total average pay last year = £546.46</p>

                <p>Then take the higher figure from methods 1 and 2:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>£585.71 (method 1: pay from same dates last year).</li>
                    <li>£546.46 (method 2: average pay last year).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Total pay based on furlough days = £585.71 </p>

                    <li>Multiply by 80%.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Calculated furlough grant = £468.57 </p>

                <p>This exceeds the maximum furlough grant for this pay period, which is:</p>

                    <li>16 furlough days in March at £80.65 + 15 furlough days in July at £83.34 = £456.92.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Therefore we use the maximum furlough grant amount.</p>
