    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme calculator</h1>

    <p>Employers can make a claim through the Job Retention Scheme if they have put their employees on temporary leave (furlough) because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.</p>

    <p>Use this calculator to work out the figures you’ll need when you complete an online claim through the scheme. It’s aimed at organisations with a small number of employees.</p>

    <p> This calculator can currently be used to work out what you can claim for most employees who are paid either regular or variable amounts each pay period (for example, weekly or monthly).</p>

    <p>It won’t work for employees who:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>receive any non-discretionary payments</li>
      <li>receive any top-up pay in the claim period</li>
      <li>returned from statutory leave such as maternity leave in the last three months</li>
      <li>get director’s payments</li>
      <li>have been transferred under TUPE</li>
      <li>have been employed at separate times throughout the year </li>
      <li>receive employer pension contributions outside of an auto-enrolment pension scheme</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We’re working to enhance the calculator to include these scenarios as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>If you cannot use this calculator, work out what you can claim manually using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/work-out-80-of-your-employees-wages-to-claim-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme">calculation guidance</a> or seek professional advice.</p>
    <p>It’s your responsibility to check that the amount you’re claiming for is correct.</p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How it works</h2>

    <p>The calculator will work out the amounts you need to enter in the claim form.</p>
    <p>These are:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>gross amount paid to a furloughed employee</li>
      <li>employer National Insurance contributions</li>
      <li>employer minimum auto-enrolment pension costs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It will also give you a breakdown of the calculations for each pay period.</p>

    <p>The figures are for one employee, for the claim period you specify. Run the calculator again for any other employees you’re claiming for and add up the results.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
    <p>You will need:</p>

      <li>end dates of the periods of time (for example monthly) that they are paid for </li>
      <li>how much they are paid (before deductions)</li>
      <li>when their furlough started (and ended, if not ongoing)</li>
