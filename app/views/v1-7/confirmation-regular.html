                <p>You told us this employee gets paid a regular amount each time. We’ve worked out their daily earnings and multiplied by the number of furlough days in each pay period. The furlough grant is 80% of this.</p>

                <p>There’s a maximum amount you can claim for furlough grant and Employer National Insurance contributions. If this affects your claim, we’ve adjusted the calculations.</p>
