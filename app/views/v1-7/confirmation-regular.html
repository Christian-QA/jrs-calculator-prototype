                <p>To calculate the furlough grant - Your employee gets paid a regular amount each time, so we apportion the amount based on the amount of furlough days in the pay period. We take the relevant pay figure and multiply it by 80% and then check its not higher than the furlough cap.</p>
                <p> To calculate the NIC grant - Take furlough grant and add any employer contribution to any top up and any additional pay and then multiply by 13.8%.  Check that is not higher than the NIC Cap.</p>
                <p> To calculate the Pension grant - Take furlough grant and deduct Lower Level of Qualifying Earnings then multiply by 3%.</p>
