        <p>For an employee who is contracted for a fixed number of hours and whose pay does not vary according to the number of hours they work. </p>

        <p>To calculate the number of usual hours for each pay period (or partial pay period):</p>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li>
                Start with the hours your employee was contracted for at the end of the last pay period ending on or before 19 March 2020.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide by the number of calendar days in the repeating working pattern, including non-working days.
            </li>
            <li>
                Multiply by the number of calendar days in the pay period (or partial pay period) you are claiming for.
            </li>
            <li>
                Round up or down if the result isn’t a whole number.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If an employee with fixed hours was on annual leave, off work sick or on family related statutory leave at any time during the last pay period ending on or before 19 March, the usual hours should be calculated as if the employee had not taken that leave.</p>
