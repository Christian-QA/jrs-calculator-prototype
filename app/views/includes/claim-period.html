            You make a claim under the Job Retention Scheme for a period during which one or more of your employees are furloughed. This is the claim period.</p>
        <p>Include all affected employees in one claim, including employees who start or end furlough on different dates within the claim period.</p>
        <p>You cannot make more than one claim covering the same claim period.</p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Claim period start date</h2>


        <p>For the first claim, this is the date the first employee was furloughed (other employees may have been furloughed at a later date). The earliest start date was 1 March 2020, which was the date the Job Retention Scheme started.</p>
        <p>If employees are still on furlough or flexible furlough after a claim period ends, make another claim later to cover the ongoing furlough period. Claim periods cannot overlap.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Claim period end date</h2>

        <p> This must fall in the same month as the start date (from 1 July). It can be up to 14 days from the date you submit the claim. Note that itâ€™s not the same as the furlough end date - furlough may be ongoing at the end of the claim period.
