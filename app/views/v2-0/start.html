    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme calculator</h1>

    <p>Use this calculator to work out the figures you’ll need when you complete a claim through the scheme. It also gives a breakdown of calculations for each pay period for your records.</p>

    <p>The figures are for one employee, for the claim period you specify. Run the calculator again for any other employees you’re claiming for and add up the results.</p>

    <p> The calculator works for most employees paid weekly, 2 weekly, 4 weekly or monthly.</p>
    <p>From1 July, employees can be brought back to work for some of their normal hours. The calculator can take this into account. </p>

    <p>It doesn’t yet work for employees who:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

      <li>returned from statutory leave such as maternity leave in the last 3 months</li>
      <li>get director’s payments</li>
      <li>have been transferred under TUPE</li>
      <li>have been employed at separate times throughout the year </li>
      <li>receive employer pension contributions outside of an auto-enrolment pension scheme</li>
    </ul>


    <p>In these cases, work out what you can claim manually using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/work-out-80-of-your-employees-wages-to-claim-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme">calculation guidance</a> or seek professional advice.</p>
    <p>It’s your responsibility to check that the amount you’re claiming for is correct.</p>
